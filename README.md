# ProteinVR

**Note: As of January 2019, this project is still ongoing** and a formal publication is being drafted related to the effectiveness of this software. 


`ProteinVR: Micro and Structural Biology in a Virtual World` is a revolutionary scientific undertaking from the Dr. Jacob D. Durrant Lab of Computational Drug Discovery ([DurrantLab Github](https://github.com/durrantlab)) at the University of Pittsburgh. We seek to leverage the power of new and inexpensive **Virtual Reality** technology to be the **first-ever software** that helps teach anatomy and molecular biology to a broad scientific audience. This softawre will be initially tailored to students at the collegiate level but can be adjusted for usage in secondary education. 

I helped revise and give feedback on the grant that went into this project, ultimately yielding **$25,000** in funding.
