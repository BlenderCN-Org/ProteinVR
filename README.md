# ProteinVR

`ProteinVR: Micro and Structural Biology in a Virtual World` is a revolutionary scientific undertaking from the Dr. Jacob D. Durrant Lab of Computational Drug Discovery ([DurrantLab](https://github.com/durrantlab)) at the University of Pittsburgh. We seek to leverage the power of new and inexpensive **Virtual Reality** technology to be the **first-ever software** that helps teach anatomy and microbiology to a broad scientific audience. This softawre will be initially tailored to students at the collegiate level but can be adjusted for usage in secondary education.
